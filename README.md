bigoletexas
===========

BigOleTexas is a Stumpgrind, Inc. project. The idea was conceived when, one day surfing the internet, we figured their
ought to be a website that allows one to compare the size of Texas to other regions, and found no such existing site.

All of the files used in the project's early beginnings are archived in the 'research' directory. However, the site itself
is primarily contained in a monolithic Camping (old ruby http framework) file, BigOleTexas.rb

The choice to use camping stems from one simple thing: we got a free hosting account at DotGeek, and Camping was (at the time) the most viable
server they offered.

The site is currently offered as is, but many improvements are possible. Please feel free to check it out, spice it up, whatever...the code is available for all.

Enjoy.
